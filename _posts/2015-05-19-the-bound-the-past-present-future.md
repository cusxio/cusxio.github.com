Let us talk about bound, and how it is relevent to the theme: *The Past, The Present, and the Future*.

The **bound** is the way in which you want certain things to happen in a certain way in life. I am sure you all can relate to this. For example fresh graduates from top Universities such as MIT or Standford usually thinks that they deserve a shot at the top companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, Apple etc, because they deserve it, because they worked hard, and they will usually fall short and get dissapointed when expectation doesn't meet reality. The key to get something in life usually don't follow a certain and clear path, it doesn't say do A then do B, then C and you shall get your Reward - No, life has never promised that, but somehow we have assumed that. The path that we have pre imposed to get certain things is the bound I am referring to, and it is *important* to understand this concept to understand this passage. 

If you set a bound or an enclosed system to everything in life, you will feel stressful, because everything have to be confine within that bound. And if it doesn't or stop confining within that bound, you will feel upset, frustrated, deceieve and cheated. And when you feel all those feelings when you feel it, you don't even know what to look for because you don't even know what's causing it. 

Because you made the bound a *reality*, an area where things have to happen according to the rules that are confined within it. It's a very dangerous and limiting mentality to have. It's detrimental to your success and your well being, because you have pre imposed the things you can achieve within it. You will lack creativity, you will lack and see the world outside of your confinement. You will lack heavily as all you rely on is on your capabilities and abilities and you don't let the world, the luck, the spontaneousism or whatever it is called takes it course.

You lack the element of suprise and you will fail to suprise yourself. 




To end things off, I would like to quote my thesis professor who have given me alot to think about.
