Reminiscing is something that I have been doing for far too long, and it needs to stop now.

I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.

You're the most amazing, beautiful girl I ever met, and somehow .. I don't know, but somehow I thought that I would have the chance to be with you.

Beause of all the reminiscing and the constant playback of moments that I deeply cherish together with you, the love I have for you back then is nothing compared to how I love you now.

Now, I love you with everything inside of me. 

I love you so much, I just want you to be happy. Even if that happiness no longer includes me. 

Some people say that you never just stop loving, and I guess that is somewhat true, but now, now is the time that I have finally decided that I have to go. I have to stop reminiscing, I have to let all of these feelings be something truly of the past. Because I have been clinging on to the past in the present for far too long without even realizing it. 



Maybe I wasn't the best guy for you afterall because of the decision that I have made today. 

Maybe this is the reason why you are the smarter one after all ;).


This is it.

This is the end.

This will be the last passage that I will write as I reminisce about you.

But before I go, I am sorry for all the things that I have done or not done.

I love you so so much ..  Don't ask me why do I love you, because I can't find the reason not to ~♥

>To let go isn’t to forget, not to think about or ignore. It doesn’t leave feelings of anger, jealousy or regret. Letting go isn’t about winning or losing. It’s not about PRIDE and it’s not about how you appear and it’s not obsessing or dwelling on the past. Letting go isn’t blocking memories or thinking sad thoughts, and it doesn’t leave emptiness, hurt or sadness. It’s not about giving in or giving up. Letting go isn’t about loss and it’s not about defeat. To let go is to cherish the memories, but to overcome and move on. It is having an open mind and confidence in the future. Letting go is learning and experiencing and growing. To let go is to be thankful for the experiences that made you laugh, made you cry and made you grow. It’s about all that you have, all that you had, and all that you will soon gain. Letting go is having the courage to accept change, and the strength to keep moving. Letting go is growing up. It is realizing that the heart can sometimes be the most potent remedy. To let go is to open a door and to clear a path and set yourself free.
