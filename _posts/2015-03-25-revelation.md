You have not gone big and go **bold** Jonathan, becasue you are afraid, very afraid. You are afraid that one day, you might need to admit that you are actually not as smart as you think you are. 

You are not prepared to fail. You are not prepared to say to the world that "Yup, I've failed". You are definitely not prepared for that.

I am not saying that you should be all that pessimistic that you are going to fail, or tell you that you need to be optimistic with what you can achieve, I am just telling you to be realistic. Be realistic with what you can achieve and when you can achieve it. 

All in all- DO NOT be afraid to fail. Do not hesitate in everything that you do. Do not look back. And do not forget to hold the responsbility for every decision that you make.

*DO NOT forget to dream Jonathan, but don't day dream.*

Have the wisdom to do what's right.
