title: Committing my First Blog Post
cover: 
---

***I told*** myself that I have to write a blog post about setting up a github page using Jekyll if I managed to set it up myself.

After ~countless of hours~ spent setting up Jekyll due to ``rvm requirements`` errors, I was finally able committing my first blog post !
